Learning rust...
Origin: C++, Destination: Rust
## Rectangle
Basically a few attempts at shoehorning C++ ways of doing things into rust 

## Vanity
Port of some C++ code I wrote to generate bitcoin vanity addresses. A nice simple problem for concurrency. Threads only need to talk when on of them has found the answer

## Misc
I'm new to algebraic enumerations and I like them! A lot.

If you think the function `int abs(int)` is safe (in terms of having well-defined output for any input) you'd be wrong!
The way two's complement works means there's one more negative integer than positive: with 8 bits that means the range is -128..127
